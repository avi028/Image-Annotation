<b>Code_Description.txt</b> : This file contains the detailed description of the both the files written 

We have used value of 'K'  for the nearest neighbour selection, one can change and check for different values by passing different value to the main function of the "Image_anno.py"

AS we have already uploaded the extracted files in '.txt' format for the training and test data. there is no use of running the <I>Read.cpp</I> file.

Directly run the <b>main(k)</b> function of the <I>Image_anno.py</I> with any integer value 'K' and it will run as per requirement.

<b>Result.txt</b>  file contain the result obtained when ran the code of <I>'k=4'</I> <I>'k=6'</I>  <I>'k=8'</I>
